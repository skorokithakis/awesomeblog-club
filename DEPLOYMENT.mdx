### Deployment

Most things should be configurable via next.config.js.

1. Fork the repo. Clone it locally.
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
3. Edit next.config.js file to include your own values.
4. Put your own blogs or links in database.json.
5. Install vercel cli by running `yarn global add vercel` or `npm i -g vercel`.
6. Create account on vercel and login on the vercel cli.
7. Run `vercel` command in the project directory.

You can also use this nice button below -

if you are not using vercel for deployment (which I recommend because it's super fast and easy), you can run `yarn build` or `npm run build` and `yarn start` or `npm start` to run it on your own server.
